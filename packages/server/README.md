## How it works

### Pre-requisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [PNPM package manager](https://pnpm.io/pt/).
In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and a REST client like [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)

You will also need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed to run the
postgres database with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

**it is very important that before running the project you configure the environment variables as indicated in the file: .env.example**

#### Run the app

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Artur-Poffo/SystemRank.git

# Access the project folder cmd/terminal
$ cd SystemRank

# install the dependencies
$ pnpm install

# Access the server package folder cmd/terminal
cd packages/server

# Inicialize the database
# In the server package directory after installing docker, run:
$ pnpm docker:init
# This script should create, start and execute migrations in a container with Postgres database

# Then when you want to stop running docker, run:
$ pnpm docker:stop
# Or just press Ctrl+c

# When you want start the container again, run
$ pnpm docker:start

# Remember to create the RSA keys for the JWT, instructions in the .env.example file

# Run the application in development mode
$ pnpm dev

# The server will start at port: 3333 - You can now test in Insomnia or another REST client: http://localhost:3333
```

#### Run tests

```bash
# Run unit tests
$ pnpm test

# Run unit tests in watch mode
$ pnpm test:watch

# Run test coverage
$ pnpm test:cov
```
